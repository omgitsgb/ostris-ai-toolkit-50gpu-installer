## üîß Requirements

- NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPU  
- Windows (recommended)  
- Python 3.12 (you **must** install it **before** running the `.bat` file)  
- Git installed and available in your system `PATH`

   - **Important:** Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

2. Download or copy the contents of [`setup_ai_toolkit_50series.bat`](setup_ai_toolkit_50series.bat) into the folder where you'd like to install `ai-toolkit`.

3. Run the `.bat` file by **double-clicking it** or executing it in a Command Prompt.

## üóÇ What the script does

The script will:

1. Clone the latest `ai-toolkit` repository from GitHub  
2. Delete the existing `requirements.txt` (if any) and create a new one with pinned dependencies  
3. Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment (`venv`)  
4. Upgrade `pip`, install `setuptools` and `wheel`  
5. Install PyTorch 2.7.1 + CUDA 12.8 and all other required packages from the custom `requirements.txt`  
6. Prepare the environment to run ComfyUI workflows optimized for RTX 50-series GPUs
